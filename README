Action Game
A simple 2D action game built with SFML. The player controls a character to shoot enemies and protect a central chest. Enemies spawn from screen edges, and the game ends when the tower's health reaches zero.

Player movement with WASD/arrows.
Shoot bullets with left-click toward the mouse cursor.
Three enemy types: Walker (200 HP, 10 dmg), Heavy (400 HP, 20 dmg), Fast (100 HP, 5 dmg).
Score counter; +1 per enemy killed.
Game over screen when tower HP = 0.
Multithreaded updates (50 ticks/sec) and rendering (60 FPS).
